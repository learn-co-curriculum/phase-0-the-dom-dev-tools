## Introduction

We've read that updating the DOM will update the browser's rendered page. Let's
try this out. We're going to change the DOM in two ways. First, we'll use
Chrome's Developer Tools ("DevTools") and our mouse to remove an element from
the DOM. Then we'll use the DevTools' JavaScript console to run JavaScript that
does the same thing.

## Demonstrate Viewing the DOM Through Chrome DevTools

Let's head back to the [Wikipedia page for Ada Lovelace][ada-wiki]. From this
web page, look at the Chrome menu bar at the top of the page. Click on "View",
then select "Developer", then "Developer Tools." This will open the Google
Developer Tools. Click on the "Elements" tab. Here we see the DOM representation
of the HTML source that was loaded into the browser.

### Select an Element With Chrome DevTools

Scroll through the Elements panel. You will see some HTML: `head` tags, `body`
tags, `div`s, etc. If the `body` element is collapsed, use the disclosure
triangle to expand it. Notice that you can mouse over different elements in the
Elements panel and see them highlighted in the browser window. Locate the `div`
nested inside `body` that has an `id` attribute of "content" and expand that as
well.

![content-element](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/the-dom-dev-tools/content-element.png)

Next, locate the `h1` element nested inside the "content" div. It should look
something like this:

![h1-element](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/the-dom-dev-tools/h1-element.png)

Click on the `h1` element; you'll see that it's highlighted in the Elements
panel. You've now selected an element with the DevTools.

### Delete an Element With Chrome DevTools

Press the delete button on your keyboard. The element will vanish from the
browser's rendered page.

### Demonstrate That the Source is Not Changed When the DOM Is

View the page source. In the Chrome menu bar, click on "View", then select
"Developer", then "View Source." You will see that the HTML is just as it
always was, with the deleted element still present.

![html-source](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/the-dom-dev-tools/html-source.png)

The changes in the DOM do not affect the HTML file on the server. When you think
about it, that makes sense. If that were true then anyone could be changing
carefully-written HTML. (Of course, in the case of Wikipedia, people _can_ edit
the content using Wikipedia's editor, but they aren't directly accessing the
underlying HTML.)

The HTML, which lives on the server, **is unchanged**.

Refresh the page by going to "View" and choosing "Reload this Page." You will be
reloading the DOM _from the source_. The page content will come back.

### Demonstrate Opening the DevTools' JavaScript Console

Above, we deleted an element by selecting it in the DevTools and pressing the
delete key. We can accomplish the same thing using JavaScript.

In DevTools, click the **Console** tab. At the prompt, type the word `document`
and press "Enter." You'll get a `#document` returned. If you hover your mouse
over the element, you'll see the entire page highlighted in the browser window.
If you expand it, you'll see that it's the exact HTML that you saw in the
**Elements** tab.

Recall that `document` is an `object`; as such, it has properties and `methods`,
including a number of different methods that can be used to return elements.
Let's find or `select` an element by speaking JavaScript with the DOM.

### Select an Element With JavaScript

In the **Console** type:

```javascript
  document.querySelector('h1');
```

This will return something like this:

```js
<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">...</h1>
```

Go ahead and click on that disclosure triangle to see more.

When we run `document.querySelector('h1');`, it returns the DOM node, which is
also a JavaScript `object`. This means that it, in turn, can have methods called
on it! This is called _method chaining_. Let's use _method chaining_ to remove
our node from the DOM.

### Delete an Element with JavaScript

Now type:

```javascript
  document.querySelector('h1').remove();
```

The heading is gone! We called `document.querySelector('h1')` to get the node;
we then used _method chaining_ to call the `remove()` method on the node object.
We use dot notation to _chain_ the calls.

Follow the same process we used earlier to verify that the source has not
changed. To restore it, simply refresh the page (i.e. reload the DOM).

### Storing Node References in Variables

Query methods like `querySelector()` and the other methods we'll be learning
about are expressions: they return a value (specifically, a DOM node). As such,
we can save the results of the query into a variable. For example:

```js
const header = document.querySelector('h1');
```

We now have a reference to that node with a meaningful name; we can simply use
`header` any time we need to refer to our node, rather than always having to
look it up with `document.querySelector()`.

You can perhaps imagine how, if we have a program that selects, creates,
modifies, or removes a large number of nodes, using this approach will result in
code that's easier to read, debug and maintain.

## Conclusion

DOM programming is using JavaScript to:

1. Ask the DOM to find or `select` an HTML element or elements in the rendered page
2. Remove the selected element(s) and/or insert new element(s)
3. Adjust a property of the selected element(s)

In this lesson you just did all that stuff! Learning to duplicate what you can
do in DevTools with JavaScript ***is*** DOM programming. The next lessons are
going to give you more methods for selecting elements and changing them, but you
just changed the DOM. High fives are in order.
